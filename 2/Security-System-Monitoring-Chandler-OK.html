<p>As you just discovered, there are 2 broad classifications of security cameras. What you usually find at stores are consumer-grade cameras, which normally come 8 or 16 cameras bundled with a video recorder and sell for less than a thousand dollars (US $) for the set. The second category of camera, commercial-grade cameras, generally starts at about $400 (United States) per camera-- a substantially higher price.

<p>Because it's more complicated than it ought to be, we don't recommend the SmartThings SmartCam. Recordings, signals, and combination all require different IFTTT-style rules. Recordings are captured as 10-second clips that are saved for as much as 24 hours, unless you pay the $8 monthly cost (or $80 per year) to save 30-second clips for thirty days. Beyond those limits, we often found action missing, thanks to prolonged and inconsistent gaps in between recordings. Also, the camera itself gets extremely hot.</p>

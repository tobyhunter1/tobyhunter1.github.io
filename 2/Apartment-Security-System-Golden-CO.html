<p>Discover how to create, construct, and install commercial grade security camera systems to increase employee safety and reduce crime. The Ring Floodlight Camera integrates 2 necessary devices in one: A home security camera and a motion-activated floodlight. When the Floodlight camera identifies movement, it turns on its two effective LED beams as well as its sharp 1080p camera, and begins recording. The Floodlight Cam also has a loud speaker, so you can talk to whoever remains in front of the camera, and hear their actions.

<p>The problem with the small, set LED IR cameras is the plastic used in front of the lens and in some cases, the actual lens.

<p>Discover how to create, construct, and install commercial grade security camera systems to increase employee safety and reduce crime. The Ring Floodlight Camera integrates 2 necessary devices in one: A home security camera and a motion-activated floodlight. When the Floodlight camera identifies movement, it turns on its two effective LED beams as well as its sharp 1080p camera, and begins recording.

<p>The problem with the small, set LED IR cameras is the plastic used in front of the lens and in some cases, the actual lens.

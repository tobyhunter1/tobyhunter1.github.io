<p>There is a new pattern in surveillance video search innovation that is rapidly altering the security industry, and it is called Deep Learning". What is Deep Knowing and why is it so important?  For beginners, Deep Learning enables someone to find what they are looking for without needing to explore hours of useless video footage.

<p>Seismic glass-break detectors, typically referred to as shock sensors, are different in that they are set up on the glass pane. When glass breaks it produces particular shock frequencies which travel through the glass and frequently through the window frame and the surrounding walls and ceiling. Generally, the most extreme frequencies produced are between 3 and 5 kHz, depending on the type of glass and the presence of a plastic interlayer. Seismic glass-break detectors feel these shock frequencies and in turn create an alarm condition.</p>

<p>Thanks to recent advancements in technology, wireless security systems are now as effective as wired systems If you have actually made the decision to install an alarm system, you should think about the following benefits of wireless innovation. The $260 Fundamentals bundle consists of the base station, a keypad, 4 entry sensing units, one motion sensing unit, a yard sign, and two window decals.

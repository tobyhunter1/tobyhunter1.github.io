<p>Some wireless home security systems offer a video recording storage option and others don't. For the ones that do not, you have the ability to see a live video feed of your home any time you access your system; however, nothing is recorded. The systems with video storage normally include either a local storage or cloud storage choice. A local storage option saves a pre-determined variety of video clips on the device itself.

Surveillance cameras are also made in these 2 resolutions, and it would be natural to believe that the more dots in your video image the better, right? Yes and no.

<p>I just ended up updating all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The crucial distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which allows you to tweak the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal change. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this very crucial feature. Likewise great metal construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get proper mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the huge choice device into the wall. Need to be a better method to implement that. But it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Great resolution - far better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and far better clarity in the evening. Hopefully these hold up throughout the years! Highly recommend.</p>

Blink Security Cameras are a fine example of a system we are continuously assisting consumers change. As experts in the market our suggestions is to keep away. If you do buy them, first check the providers return policy and 2nd keep the receipt.</p>

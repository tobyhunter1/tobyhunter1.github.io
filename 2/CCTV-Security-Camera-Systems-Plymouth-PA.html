<p>When looking at a normal camera image, you would be hard-pressed to inform the distinction in between 1080p and 4K resolution. The one major advantage of 4K resolution is the capability to deal with detail after the reality, which means that users can zoom in on details such as faces while the recording of a security event plays.

<p>Because it's more complicated than it ought to be, we do not advise the SmartThings SmartCam. Recordings, alerts, and combination all require separate IFTTT-style guidelines. Recordings are recorded as 10-second clips that are saved for as much as 24 hours, unless you pay the $8 month-to-month fee (or $80 per year) to store 30-second clips for 1 month. Beyond those limits, we often discovered action missing, thanks to irregular and prolonged spaces in between recordings. Likewise, the camera itself gets exceedingly hot.</p>
<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this problem with a special light-handling function. These cameras utilize both a software and hardware solution called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the room and an exposure of the doorway and then combines the 2 images together to develop a properly-exposed composite picture of the 2 locations. As far as anybody is concerned, the image looks completely typical considering that the entrance and space seem at the very same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are correctly exposed at the door and in the shop, achieving the objective of catching video of everybody getting in the shop. HDR is now a basic feature in commercial cameras. Regrettably, once consumers recognize that the economical consumer camera they purchased is doing not have HDR, it's typically far too late considering that the cameras and recorders are installed.</p>

<p>The problem with the small, fixed LED IR cameras is the plastic utilized in front of the lens and in many cases, the real lens. After a few years in the harsher climates, this plastic tends to fade and become milky.

<p>This cool clever alarm has a motion detector and siren in one device. Throughout screening, we found it was simple to arm and deactivate and the motion detection was accurate, with the siren quickly triggering when movement was discovered. We like that it also lets you understand when other alarms are going off, such as a smoke or CO2 detector. For most homes, you'll require numerous Minuts throughout your residential or commercial property, which can get pricey. It's likewise worth noting that it has to be installed on the ceiling (it only keeps track of for motion in the 25m squared below), which is fiddly. It likewise had the quietest alarm of all that we checked and there's no external monitoring service available.</p>
<p>Neither the light nor the camera is especially remarkable by itself. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, but it's just 720p-- and we're starting to anticipate 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera market. With that stated, we wouldn't suggest this system to tech-lovers, as we think the functions are a little too basic. For example, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more smart home features. But if simple Do It Yourself installation, no-contracts, and low-priced monitoring is your thing, we think you'll love SimpliSafe.</p>

<p>Keypad: A mobile phone app is a need to for use when you're away from home, however you should not have to fumble with your phone when you're coming and going. A keypad can sit by the front door, making it easy to arm and deactivate the system. If you already own a Ring video doorbell and want to expand your home security protection, including Ring Alarm makes good sense. When you add other Ring items to Call Alarm it ends up being a more robust security system that can deliver live video streaming, two-way interaction, and clever lighting.

<p>Neither the camera nor the light is especially excellent on its own. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, but it's just 720p-- and we're beginning to expect 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera market. With that stated, we would not recommend this system to tech-lovers, as we think the features are a little too basic. For example, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more clever home features. However if simple DIY installation, no-contracts, and inexpensive monitoring is your thing, we think you'll love SimpliSafe.</p>

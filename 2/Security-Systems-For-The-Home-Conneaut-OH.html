It can compare general motion and individuals, so it minimizes incorrect alarms, and it can even recognize individuals you have actually identified (after a knowing period). But like all Nest cameras, this one requires the Nest Aware service to do anything beyond live viewing.</p>

Due to the fact that it doesn't have wires that can be cut, it also makes your camera more tamper-proof. Sadly I bought 4 cameras that look similar to these, believing I was going to conserve $14.00 per camera for the very same camera. Young boy was I incorrect!! These cameras are true 1080p and work perfectly right out of the box. They are well lined up and focused. The clarity is truly great. Night vision is true 1080p at around 40ft, but still can see pretty good after that. These cameras are what you need to buy, and do not go cheap.</p>

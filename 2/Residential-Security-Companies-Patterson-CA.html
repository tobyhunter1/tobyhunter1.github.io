<p>Arlo constructs fantastic home security cameras, and this third-generation Arlo Pro is a prime example of what this company can. While it does not have the eye-popping 4K resolution of the Arlo Ultra, it delivers wonderful video quality and many of that more-expensive camera's other signature features for less. And it can be deployed inside or out. The Brinks Home Security system is available in 2 plan choices. The Home Complete model is $29 per month.

<p>Neither the camera nor the light is particularly excellent on its own. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, but it's only 720p-- and we're beginning to anticipate 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera market. With that stated, we wouldn't suggest this system to tech-lovers, as we think the functions are a little too basic. For instance, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more smart home features. But if easy DIY installation, no-contracts, and low-priced monitoring is your thing, we think you'll like SimpliSafe.</p>

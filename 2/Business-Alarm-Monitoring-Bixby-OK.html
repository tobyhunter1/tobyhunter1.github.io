<p>The issue with the small, fixed LED IR cameras is the plastic used in front of the lens and in some cases, the real lens. After a couple of years in the harsher climates, this plastic tends to fade and become milky. This makes it difficult for the CCD or CMOS sensing unit to effectively equate the imagery, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can trigger a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Inside, these gadgets have a far longer life span, however outdoors, or even in a garage without climate control, a lot of them lose their sharpness and clearness succumbing to the harsh environment.</p>

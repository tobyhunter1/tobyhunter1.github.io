<p>With modern alarm system systems from Security Instrument, you and your family will have the very best defense possible from burglaries and theft. For instance, no other company can monitor a SimpliSafe, Cox, Brinks Home, or Xfinity Home system. These companies developed their equipment in this manner to make clients stay with them longer, since changing monitoring companies means hundreds of dollars down the drain and a big headache for customers. How did they do it? They put five routers, DVRs and IP cameras on the open web. They were all running their newest software application and firmware. According to the report, one device was hacked within a couple of minutes, while the rest were done and cleaned within a day. They didn't say which device was the very first, and the last to fall, however.</p>

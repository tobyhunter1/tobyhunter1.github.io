Siren Numerous one-box systems like Canary and Somfy come with an extremely loud built-in siren that ought to hopefully scare off burglars (or next door's cat).

If a person was standing enjoying outside a window it might be a crime, yet the very same individual might put a surveillance camera then remotely view a person within the privacy of their home.

<p>Analog security cameras send lower resolution video over coax cable and record to a Digital Video Recorder (DVR) which can manage such things as scheduling, motion detection, and digital zoom. The DVR transforms the analog signal to digital, compresses it, and then shops it on a hard disk drive for later retrieval. Screens can be linked to the DVR for seeing, or the system can be established to communicate by means of network or mobile app for viewing.</p>

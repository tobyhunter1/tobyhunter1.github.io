<p>Neither the light nor the camera is particularly remarkable on its own. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, but it's only 720p-- and we're starting to expect 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera market. With that stated, we would not recommend this system to tech-lovers, as we believe the features are a little too basic.

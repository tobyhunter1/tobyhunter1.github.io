<p>We looked for DIY systems that offered professional monitoring, both with and without a contract. Although some companies supply heavily affordable or totally free hardware in exchange for a service commitment that can last anywhere from one to 5 years, we discovered no-contract systems to be the most flexible. Some people might want to sign up for service just for when they or their partner is out of town, for instance.

<p>The loudest of the wise alarm systems we tested, the Somfy Home Alarm Video does a good task at alerting anybody in your house and those nearby that there's a problem. Throughout testing, the siren was quick to sound when any of the sensors were activated and we enjoy that the sensitivity of the motion sensor can be gotten used to represent pets, too. The alarm system is just one of 2 we evaluated that includes an external siren, and we're pleased that it likewise comes with a dummy siren that can be attached to another external wall, even more dissuading anyone from trying to break in to your home. We tested Somfy's more pricey system, which came with a wifi security camera, however more inexpensive kits are also readily available. Regardless of the large price here, there's no external monitoring choice.</p>
<p>The Hive View delivers great 1080p images day and night, but the motion activation triggered too quickly, even when on the most affordable level of sensitivity setting. Given that this camera has no native geofencing functions, you have to by hand stop notifications (and recording, given that it does that even when alerts are off). We also experienced above-average connectivity issues, with two Hive test systems disconnecting eight times over two months. Scout is extremely easy to use, particularly if you're a fan of mobile phones. The Scout mobile app works for iOS, Android, and web-based internet browsers, and it enables you to control almost every aspect of the security system from another location, and it's highly adjustable.

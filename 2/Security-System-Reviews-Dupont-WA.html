The essential difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which enables you to modify the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely essential function. Also nice metal building. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get correct mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the substantial choice gadget into the wall. Should be a better method to execute that. However it was simply a little notch so not an offer breaker. Very good resolution - much better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and much better clarity during the night. Ideally these hold up over the years! Highly recommend.</p>

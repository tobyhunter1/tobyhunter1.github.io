<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this problem with a special light-handling feature.

As far as anyone is worried, the image looks entirely typical because the entrance and space appear to be at the very same brightness level. As a result, faces are correctly exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the objective of capturing video of everyone entering the shop. HDR is now a basic feature in commercial cameras. Unfortunately, as soon as consumers realize that the affordable customer camera they purchased is lacking HDR, it's normally too late since the cameras and recorders are set up.</p>

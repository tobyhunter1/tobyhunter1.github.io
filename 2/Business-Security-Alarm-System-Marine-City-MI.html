<p>The problem with the small, fixed LED IR cameras is the plastic utilized in front of the lens and sometimes, the actual lens. After a few years in the harsher climates, this plastic tends to fade and end up being milky. This makes it difficult for the CCD or CMOS sensor to effectively equate the imagery, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can cause a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Inside, these devices have a far longer life span, but outdoors, or even in a garage without climate control, a lot of them lose their sharpness and clarity succumbing to the severe environment.</p>

<h3>Best Home Security Companies in Michigan</h3>

We 'd probably advise a company like Vivint, ADT, or Frontpoint if you're beginning from scratch.</p>

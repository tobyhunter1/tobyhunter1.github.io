<p>I just finished upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The essential difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which permits you to modify the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal change. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely important function. Also good metal building. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get correct mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the big choice gadget into the wall. Need to be a much better method to carry out that. But it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker.

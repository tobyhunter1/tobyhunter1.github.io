<p>I simply completed upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The key distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which enables you to modify the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal change. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this really essential feature. Likewise nice metal building and construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get correct mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the substantial choice device into the wall. Must be a much better way to carry out that. However it was simply a little notch so not an offer breaker. Very good resolution - far better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and better clearness at night. Hopefully these hold up over the years! Highly recommend.</p>

Look at the ceiling of consumer electronic devices shops and warehouse chains and you will see in each aisle a white dome camera that is bigger than the typical customer camera.

<p>Nonetheless, multi-megapixel IP-CCTV cameras are coming on the market. Still rather expensive, but they can capture video images at resolutions of 1, 2, 3, 5 and even up to 11 Mpix. Unlike with analogue cameras, information such as number plates are quickly readable. At 11 Mpix, forensic quality images are made where each hand on an individual can be distinguished.

<p>When utilizing IP cameras - as most CCTV systems do nowadays - you will most likely be taking a look at Cat5E or Cat6 cables, which can move the large amount of information required by digital video and high resolutions at very quick speeds, and often over long distances. This is an upgrade from the coax cabling that typically powers analog security cameras; coax cables are trustworthy, however not compatible with IP cameras. In most cases, Cat5e and Cat6 cable televisions will also power the security cameras, removing the requirement for additional electrical wiring. This is called Power-Over-Ethernet and needs a PoE switch when the security cameras are not linked to an NVR. Wireless security cameras may need less circuitry in the walls but will still need cable televisions to power the security camera separately, usually via 110VAC power.</p>

<p>The growing presence of public cameras will bring extensive but subtle changes to the character of our public spaces. When residents are being seen by the authorities - or mindful they may be viewed at any time - they are more uncomfortable and less free-wheeling. As syndicated columnist Jacob Sullum has explained, "knowing that you are being watched by armed federal government representatives tends to put a damper on things. You do not want to offend them or otherwise call attention to yourself." Ultimately, he warns, "individuals may learn to be cautious about the periodicals and books they check out in public, avoiding titles that may alarm hidden observers. They may likewise put more thought into how they dress, lest they appear like terrorists, gang hookers, members or drug addicts." Undoubtedly, the research studies of cameras in Britain found that individuals deemed to be "out of time and location" with the surroundings were subjected to prolonged surveillance.</p>

<p>Three huge advantages of wireless security systems for renters are their portability, expandability and impermanence. Renters, unlike homeowners, typically prevent making irreversible changes to their homes.

On the other hand, wireless security uses equipment that's either freestanding or affixed to walls and entranceways with detachable adhesive. Wireless control panels, sensors and other elements can easily be set up at various properties later, and wireless systems are easily broadened with new components too. Wireless security plans also enable remote control of the system and general home automation.

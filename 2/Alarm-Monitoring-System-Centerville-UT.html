The camera can tape video in as much as 1080p, which looks completely great on a smartphone screen and will not tax your web connection excessive.

<p>Unlike most other cameras we checked, the corded Circle 2 does not have sensitivity settings for motion detection (though the cordless design does ). Instead, you can filter event notices only by high activity, days, or individual (the latter is offered just with a paid Circle Safe membership). Without a paid Circle Safe membership, you'll get more signals, which you can only filter to get every minute, 15 minutes, or thirty minutes. The subscription is better when used in high-traffic locations. Otherwise, the Smart Place feature can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to prevent alerts each time you stroll by.

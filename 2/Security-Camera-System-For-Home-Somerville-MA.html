<p>The disadvantage to a wireless system is that it counts on a wireless signal, suggesting that storms and strong winds have the power to disrupt the system and could even set off false alarms. Incorrect alarms are known to be more common with wireless security systems than with wired ones and they might lead to fines from the provider or the cops if they take place often enough. Another prospective drawback to wireless security is that the batteries on each tool should be replaced or charged regularly in order to keep the system working. Wireless equipment can also be more expensive than the equipment for a wired security system, though that is generally offset by the truth that there are no installation expenses.</p>
<p>Cameras with built in wifi that speak with an existing network must be within 300 feet for ideal efficiency.

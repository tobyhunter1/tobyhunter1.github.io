<p>The hermetically sealed reed switch is an extremely typical kind of two piece sensing unit that operates with an electrically conductive reed switch that is either normally open or generally closed when under the impact of an electromagnetic field as in the case of distance to the 2nd piece which consists of a magnet. When the magnet is moved away from the reed switch, the reed switch either opens or closes, again based upon whether or not the style is usually open or typically closed.

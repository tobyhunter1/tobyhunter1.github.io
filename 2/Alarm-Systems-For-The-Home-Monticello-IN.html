<p>The real reason cameras are typically deployed is to minimize much pettier crimes. But it has not even been shown that they can do that.

"Once the criminal activity and offense figures were gotten used to take account of the general down trend in criminal offenses and offenses," criminologists found in one research study, "decreases were kept in mind in particular classifications but there was no proof to recommend that the cameras had reduced criminal activity overall in the city centre." A 2005 research study for the British Office also found that cameras did not cut criminal offense or the fear of crime (as had a 2002 research study, also for the British federal government).</p>

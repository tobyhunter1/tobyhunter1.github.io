<p>Pelco uses video surveillance cameras and video management services for commercial environments such as office complexes, shopping centers, others, and hotels. Some people may state that we must not have surveillance cameras in public places. They claim that they attack personal privacy. The argument here, however, is why be out in public if you want personal privacy? Surveillance cameras are suggested to keep you and other property safe, not to stalk you. Cameras exist not to invade an individual's personal privacy but to safeguard the general public by deterring criminal activity and by supplying product evidence when a crime has been captured on movie.</p>

<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is not excellent but good-- and so it isn't worth paying twice the cost of its predecessor. When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime watching. However, color night vision image quality is frustrating, and the motion tracking function is a bit wonky. Likewise, the Pro 3 provides no free storage, and external storage can't be seen through the app, just by means of a computer system. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, however for now, we still believe the Arlo Pro 2 is a much better buy. Both are still much better than the pricey Arlo Ultra, which we discovered to have terrible night-vision performance, bad battery life, and a propensity to miss far too many motion activates.</p>

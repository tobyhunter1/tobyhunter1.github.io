The Arlo Pro 2 is also the only cord-free 1080p camera on our list that uses 7 days of complimentary cloud storage (with more readily available for a month-to-month fee ). Nevertheless, the camera will reset the sensing unit in between recordings, which Arlo says will permit the camera to properly identify motion and not get stuck recording on a loop.

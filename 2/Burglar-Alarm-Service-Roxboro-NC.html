<p>Ring may not be the most advanced system on our list (Vivint takes that reward), but it sure has gotten rather the excitement over the years. We've been testing Ring Alarm quite a bit lately, and we really like the system for what it is. So what is it? Well, it's a prepackaged security kit that uses basic intrusion protection with super-low month-to-month monitoring fees. Or ... no monitoring charges at all if you choose the free self-monitor" alternative.</p>
<p>This system utilizes an electro-magnetic field disruption concept based upon 2 unshielded (or 'leaky') coaxial cables buried around 30 cm (1 feet) deep and 1 m (10 feet) apart. 6 The transmitter emits continuous Radio Frequency (RF) energy along one cable and the energy is gotten by the other cable television. When the modification in field strength compromises due to the presence of an object and reaches a pre-set lower limit, an alarm condition is created. The system is covert after installation. Care should be taken to make sure the surrounding soil uses good drainage in order to prevent annoyance alarms.</p>

Instead, when you link a PoE switch to your network, you have actually got a source of power and a way of transmitting information to your NVR all in one package. The most significant consideration when picking which type of PoE switch to buy is the variety of cameras that will be on your system. The next factor to consider is how most likely you are to scale up in the future.</p>

A couple of designs utilize batteries, making placement more flexible, however this requires other trade-offs, which we highlight in the Competitors section. Wi-Fi coverage also affects where you position a camera: If you wish to put a camera in a spot that does not get a good Wi-Fi signal, consider updating your router or adding an extender or repeater.

This builds in increased protection and a stop working safe ought to a door blow open or a bird rattle an outside window.</p>

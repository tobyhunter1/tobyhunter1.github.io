The essential difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which enables you to fine-tune the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal modification.

Should be a better method to carry out that. But it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker. Great resolution - better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and far better clearness at night. Ideally these hold up throughout the years! Extremely recommend.</p>

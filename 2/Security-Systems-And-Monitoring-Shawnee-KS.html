During the installation, you'll get personalized security recommendations so you can be sure you get precisely what you require for your home.</p>
<p>ADT licensed provider SafeStreets charges a $99 (or more) installation cost, however the brand doesn't otherwise charge up front for a system it says deserves $1,300.

ADT uses an independent distributor model including third-party dealerships. The dealers figure out which equipment to use. Costs for systems vary.

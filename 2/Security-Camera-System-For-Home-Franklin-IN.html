<p>I just ended up updating all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The essential distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which permits you to tweak the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this very important feature. Also good metal building. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get right mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the big selection gadget into the wall. Should be a much better method to carry out that. But it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker.

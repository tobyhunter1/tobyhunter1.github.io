<p>I simply ended up updating all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The key distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which allows you to modify the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely essential feature. Also good metal building and construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get correct mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the big selection device into the wall. Should be a much better method to implement that. But it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker.

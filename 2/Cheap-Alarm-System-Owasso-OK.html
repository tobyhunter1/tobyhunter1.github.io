<p>We've long been fans of the Netatmo Invite camera (₤ 199), with its downplayed appearances and face recognition software. The latter enables you to see exactly when a particular individual comes to your home - so you'll when the kids got home from school and if they were alone, and whether the cleaner showed up on time.

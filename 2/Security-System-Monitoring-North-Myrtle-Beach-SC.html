<p>Developing a secure and safe environment for a commercial or house is the responsibility of the entire community. Storage capacity: For video recorders, the very first question you need to ask yourself is just how much storage you will need. The answer depends upon a couple of aspects: the variety of cameras in your system, each camera's resolution, the amount of archived video you plan to store and the length of time you prepare to keep recorded video. The footage is going to consume up storage space quickly if there are many cameras shooting in a higher resolution.

Whichever route you take, here are a couple of things you require to understand and some ideas to assist you along.</p>
<p>When utilizing IP cameras - as a lot of CCTV systems do these days - you will more than likely be taking a look at Cat5E or Cat6 cable televisions, which can move the large quantity of information required by digital video and high resolutions at very quick speeds, and typically over cross countries. This is an upgrade from the coax cabling that typically powers analog security cameras; coax cable televisions are trusted, but not compatible with IP cameras. In a lot of cases, Cat5e and Cat6 cable televisions will also power the security cameras, eliminating the requirement for additional wiring. When the security cameras are not linked to an NVR, this is called Power-Over-Ethernet and requires a PoE switch. Wireless security cameras might require less electrical wiring in the walls but will still need cable televisions to power the security camera independently, generally by means of 110VAC power.</p>

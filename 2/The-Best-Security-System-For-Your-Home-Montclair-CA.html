<p>No false alarm charges: House owners with a self-monitored system are less likely to dispatch the police for a false alarm. Because the house owner is in charge of the system, police are just contacted if there's a genuine emergency situation.

<p>Seismic glass-break detectors, typically referred to as shock sensors, are various in that they are set up on the glass pane. When glass breaks it produces particular shock frequencies which travel through the glass and frequently through the window frame and the surrounding walls and ceiling.

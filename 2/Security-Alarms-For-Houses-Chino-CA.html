<p>Thanks to recent developments in innovation, wireless security systems are now as reliable as wired systems If you've made the decision to install an alarm system, you need to consider the following benefits of wireless innovation. For some, that may be worth the $300 price tag.

With the ability to focus and out without forfeiting its focus.

<p>This system utilizes an electro-magnetic field disruption principle based on two unshielded (or 'leaky') coaxial cables buried around 30 cm (1 ft) deep and 1 m (10 feet) apart. 6 The transmitter emits constant Radio Frequency (RF) energy along one cable television and the energy is received by the other cable television. When the change in field strength compromises due to the presence of an item and reaches a pre-set lower limit, an alarm condition is generated. The system is covert after installation. Care should be required to ensure the surrounding soil provides good drain in order to avoid annoyance alarms.</p>
<p>The problem with the small, fixed LED IR cameras is the plastic used in front of the lens and in some cases, the real lens. After a couple of years in the harsher climates, this plastic tends to fade and become milky. This makes it tough for the CCD or CMOS sensor to effectively translate the imagery, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can cause a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Inside, these devices have a far longer life span, however outdoors, or even in a garage without climate control, much of them lose their sharpness and clearness catching the severe environment.</p>

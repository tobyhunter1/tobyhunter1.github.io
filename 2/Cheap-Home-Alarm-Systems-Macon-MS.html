<p>SimpliSafe has a better-looking system than Ring, with voice triggers and support for Google Assistant in addition to Amazon Alexa (however not Apple HomeKit). It likewise has add-ons such as a video camera, a doorbell camera, smoke alarms, and extra sensors. Unlike the Ring Alarm, nevertheless, it doesn't provide self-monitoring options or outdoor cameras; you also can't add any non-SimpliSafe gadgets, and live client service is offered only from 9:00 a.m. to 12:00 a.m. Eastern.</p>

<p>Neither the light nor the camera is especially impressive on its own. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, however it's just 720p-- and we're beginning to anticipate 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera market. With that said, we wouldn't suggest this system to tech-lovers, as we think the features are a little too basic. For example, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more clever home features. However if easy DIY installation, no-contracts, and low-priced monitoring is your thing, we think you'll like SimpliSafe.</p>

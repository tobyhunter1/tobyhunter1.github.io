Likewise, the Pro 3 provides no totally free storage, and external storage can't be seen through the app, just by means of a computer system. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still think the Arlo Pro 2 is a better buy. Both are still better than the pricey Arlo Ultra, which we discovered to have dreadful night-vision efficiency, bad battery life, and a propensity to miss far a lot of motion sets off.</p>

This system is what interacts with all of the security sensing units and smart-home elements in your house. Many link to a home router, however if yours has Wi-Fi or cellular support, positioning is more flexible. When they open, contact sensors are the very first thing you need to buy alongside the base station; these connect to windows and doors and will alert you.

Which suggests if the doors are shut electrical current can be moved throughout the circuits. If somebody were to open the door that would indicate that the electrical current can no longer be transferred, which would then trigger the burglar alarm. However, in an open circuit security system, unlocking allows for the electrical current to flow throughout the system, which means when the doors are shut the burglar alarm will set off.</p>

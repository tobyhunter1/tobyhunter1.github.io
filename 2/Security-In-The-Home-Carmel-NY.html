Recordings are captured as 10-second clips that are kept for as much as 24 hr, unless you pay the $8 monthly cost (or $80 annually) to save 30-second clips for thirty days. Beyond those limitations, we often discovered action missing, thanks to inconsistent and prolonged gaps in between recordings. Also, the camera itself gets exceptionally hot.</p>

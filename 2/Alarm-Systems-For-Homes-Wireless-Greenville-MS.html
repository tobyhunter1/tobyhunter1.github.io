<p>CR's take: The Wyze Cam V2 is a fantastic security camera and an extraordinary value. It gets an Exceptional rating for video quality and is much easier to utilize than the other cameras on this list. It also does well in our personal privacy and security tests. The camera features a rolling 14 days of free storage for motion-trigged video clips, individual detection, voice control via Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant, and the ability to save footage locally on an SD card. Unlike the other cameras on this list, Wyze does not use paid subscription plans for extra cloud storage. However the company does provide a Complete Motion Capture service that constantly records for as long as motion is discovered. Without an sd or the service card for local storage, the camera stops recording after 12 seconds.</p>
<p>The motion detection is excellent, and the app is a satisfaction to utilize also (a lot much better than the apps you get with some spending plan security cameras), though if you want to enter into its cleverest customisations, there is a little bit of a knowing curve. For all the more basic smarts, it's terrific, though.

<p>The NVR removes these issues, since it is rather connected straight to a network. IP cameras that are linked to the exact same network, typically by way of a PoE switch, are then able to transfer video to the NVR.

There are no proximity restrictions so long as a camera is linked to the very same network as the NVR. The biggest disadvantage to an NVR system, however, is that not every IP camera will deal with every NVR.

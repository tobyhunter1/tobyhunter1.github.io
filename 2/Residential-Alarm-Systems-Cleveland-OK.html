The very same holds true for security and video surveillance. Normally, CCTV is most reliable as an active system, with a security personnel monitoring the passages and another person, someplace, enjoying video surveillance screens for assistance. Everything is synchronized and whatever happens in real time.</p>
<p>Another essential subject to discuss is camera resolution. It can be confusing to comprehend how much suffices.

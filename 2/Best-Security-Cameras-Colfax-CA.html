<p>I simply finished upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The essential difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which permits you to modify the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely crucial feature. Likewise nice metal building and construction.

Should be a better method to implement that. However it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker. Very good resolution - much better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and much better clearness in the evening. Ideally these hold up throughout the years! Highly suggest.</p>

<p>I just completed upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The crucial distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which enables you to modify the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this really important feature. Also great metal building. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get correct mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the huge selection device into the wall. Should be a much better method to carry out that. But it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker. Great resolution - far better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and far better clearness during the night. Ideally these hold up over the years! Highly recommend.</p>

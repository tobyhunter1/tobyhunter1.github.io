<p>Unlike a lot of other cameras we evaluated, the corded Circle 2 does not have level of sensitivity settings for motion detection (though the cordless model does ). Instead, you can filter event alerts only by high activity, days, or person (the latter is readily available only with a paid Circle Safe subscription). Without a paid Circle Safe subscription, you'll get more notifies, which you can just filter to get every minute, 15 minutes, or 30 minutes. The membership is more useful when utilized in high-traffic areas. Otherwise, the Smart Place feature can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to avoid notifies each time you walk by. Oddly, though the app supports several users, its geofencing applies to each user separately, so if everybody in your household has the Circle app set up, you'll still get notifications when other individuals are home.</p>

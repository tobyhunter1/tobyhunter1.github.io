<p>We needed guards for our annual Coats for the Cold event to secure the line camping tent and structure, keep order in the wee hours of the morning and to start the heating system at 5am. The very first guard arrived early so he could look at the whole location and speak with me about my concerns. He was expert, considerate and really reassuring. The second guard arrived in the middle of the night and took over. When I showed up in the morning to get the event started, he was likewise professional, polite and encouraging. We were very delighted with your service and I will advise that we contact your company next year for this event. Thank you, Dennis and Henry, for a good night's sleep.

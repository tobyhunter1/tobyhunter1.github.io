The mobile app especially makes it simple to manage and monitor whatever straight from your smartphone.</p>
<p>You can choose from SimpliSafe's initial award-winning system or their latest line of equipment. Both systems offer impressive, trusted home security. With the more recent system, you will pay more, however that greater price comes with a system that is smaller, faster, and more powerful. At half the size of the initial system, the small sensing units are practically undetectable. The new system works 5 times faster, and the alarm is 50% louder to scare off trespassers.</p>
<p>Neither the camera nor the light is particularly excellent on its own. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, however it's only 720p-- and we're beginning to anticipate 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera market. With that said, we would not advise this system to tech-lovers, as we believe the features are a little too basic. For example, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more smart home features. But if simple DIY installation, no-contracts, and inexpensive monitoring is your thing, we believe you'll love SimpliSafe.</p>

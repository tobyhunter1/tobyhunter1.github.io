<p>The NVR eliminates these problems, since it is rather connected directly to a network. IP cameras that are connected to the very same network, usually by way of a PoE switch, are then able to transmit video to the NVR. Systems based around an NVR are a lot easier to scale up than DVR systems, merely due to the fact that they can accept a new camera once it is contributed to the network. In the worst case, all that would be required is an additional PoE switch. Some IP cameras are also wireless and can send video footage to the NVR over Wi-Fi. There are no distance limitations so long as a camera is linked to the exact same network as the NVR. The largest drawback to an NVR system, however, is that not every IP camera will deal with every NVR. So you'll need to understand whether your cameras will be compatible with a provided video recorder prior to buying.</p>

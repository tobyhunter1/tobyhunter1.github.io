<p>Among IP security choices, there are wired, wireless, and wire-free cameras. Wireless cameras collect and send information over a wireless network. These security cameras connect to a user's home wifi network and allows that user to see the video from anywhere. A typical misunderstanding is that wireless indicates the camera is wire-free. This is not the case as wireless cameras might still need a power cord. Wired security cameras are linked to a recorder directly which then links to a router and the web. Finally, wire-free cameras are totally cable television complimentary and battery powered. Although battery replacements are required, these are the easiest choice to install and all of the recorded video footage is kept in the cloud.</p>

These types of cameras normally use rechargeable batteries that can be easily popped out and taken indoors for charging with a USB cable television, but they tend to drain quickly in cooler weather condition. Bluetooth cameras are also simple to install, but you have to remain within 40 feet or so to link to them with your phone.</p>

Using a long enough random password (e.g. 14 random letters) or passphrase (e.g. 5 arbitrarily selected words) makes pre-shared key WPA virtually uncrackable. The 2nd generation of the WPA security protocol (WPA2) is based on the final IEEE 802.11 i modification to the 802.11 requirement and is qualified for FIPS 140-2 compliance.

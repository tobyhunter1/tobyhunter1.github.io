<p>As an inducement to buy an alarm, a variety of companies provide "free monitoring services" for the first few months. Many insurance provider offer discount rates on insurance premiums to clients with operable alarm systems. These discount rates may be as much as 20 percent for commercial consumers, and slightly less for residential owners. 16 In addition, lots of police departments use several "complimentary" incorrect alarms prior to enforcing any fine, even though the cost to respond is substantial right from the start. The deals of free monitoring services by alarm companies and discount rates from insurance companies call into question the appropriateness of the existing pattern in U.S. policing of enabling three or four complimentary incorrect alarms per fiscal year, due to the fact that they supply no up-front rewards to encourage owners to avoid false alarms.</p>

Salt Lake City requires verification from a personal guard. A number of cities likewise require an authorization to even own and run a home security system. Rules such as these are designed to limit the time and resources that police and fire departments waste on false alarms. Many towns will fine you for too many false alarms.</p>

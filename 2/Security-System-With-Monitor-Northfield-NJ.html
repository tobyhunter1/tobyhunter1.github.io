The master control board is the hub of the security system. When any of the security sensing units are breached by an intruder, the control board relays a message to the monitoring service or sets off your home-mounted alarm.</p>
<p>Most home security cameras perform the same basic functions-- they spot an event, record the event, and send you an alert-- but they don't all perform them the exact same way.

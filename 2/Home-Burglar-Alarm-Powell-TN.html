<p>Frontpoint's Interactive plan gives you home automation control so you can access and control your lights, locks, and thermostat all from your smart device. Just keep in mind: you do not get camera support with this plan. Sonitrol's wireless security systems provide real-time alerts through a secure cellular connection, so no electric or phone lines are required. If you are experiencing a phone, power or web  service failure, the system consists of a battery back-up and still signals an emergency to our call center.

<p>Flood sensing units don't prevent water from entering your home, they just signal you as quickly as wetness is discovered. The prompt alert provides you time to treat the scenario before any major damage occurs. All three of our top choices for Seattle offer battery-powered flood or water sensing units. They link to the company's respective app, so you're constantly in the know. Frontpoint's flood sensors cost simply $44.99 and provide three to 5 times more variety than ADT's and Vivint's. The batteries last for 8-10 years too, so that's one less thing to fret about.</p>
<p>Neither the light nor the camera is particularly remarkable by itself. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, but it's only 720p-- and we're starting to expect 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera market. With that stated, we wouldn't recommend this system to tech-lovers, as we think the features are a little too basic. For instance, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more smart home functions. However if easy Do It Yourself installation, no-contracts, and affordable monitoring is your thing, we think you'll enjoy SimpliSafe.</p>

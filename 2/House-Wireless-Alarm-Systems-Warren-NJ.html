<p>The Nest Camera Outdoor's 1080p images and sound were remarkable in our testing-- during the day and in the evening-- with a broad, 130-degree field of vision and 8 x digital zoom that enabled us to get a closer view in live video. We ought to keep in mind that the camera would periodically downgrade the photo quality based upon available bandwidth, which might vary throughout the day.

<p>The Canary is among the biggest cameras we checked, and it provides two-way communication with its paid Canary Subscription. The price of the Canary View makes the size a bit more tasty, but the image isn't as sharp, and recording wasn't consistent throughout our testing. The Netatmo Welcome does not have two-way audio or digital zoom, and it continuously asked us to recognize already-identified faces. And regardless of having an attractive rate and good efficiency, the Yi 1080p Home Camera has complicated cloud storage that adds $65 to $150 each year to the cost of an otherwise spending plan camera.</p>

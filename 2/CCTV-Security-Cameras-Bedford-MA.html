After reading the discuss this page I went to Armorax's site to see what they offered; they've partnered with another security company and their starter package I believe starts at $0 down.

Smart Home features consist of HD video monitoring by means of wireless security cameras, energy use monitoring with smart thermostats, and other house control consisting of automated locks in addition to garage door manages - which can all be controlled with apps.</p>
<p>I just finished updating all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The crucial distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which permits you to fine-tune the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this very essential feature. Likewise nice metal building and construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get appropriate mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the substantial selection gadget into the wall. Should be a better way to execute that. But it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Great resolution - far better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and better clarity during the night. Ideally these hold up over the years! Highly advise.</p>

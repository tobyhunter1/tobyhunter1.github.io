<p>Canary has actually got over some preliminary software issues to provide a very decent security camera option: particularly that crisp 1080p video, with a 147-degree field of view, night vision and motion informs (plus clear audio). What's more, that 90+ decibel siren makes it more of a severe security camera than some others here (though it needs to be manually activated when you find something amiss).

<p>The Canary is among the biggest cameras we evaluated, and it provides two-way interaction with its paid Canary Subscription. The rate of the Canary View makes the size a bit more palatable, but the image isn't as sharp, and recording wasn't constant during our testing. The Netatmo Invite does not have two-way audio or digital zoom, and it constantly asked us to acknowledge already-identified faces. And in spite of having an attractive price and good efficiency, the Yi 1080p Home Camera has confusing cloud storage that includes $65 to $150 each year to the cost of an otherwise budget camera.</p>
<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is good but not excellent-- therefore it isn't worth paying twice the rate of its predecessor. When the two are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime watching. Nevertheless, color night vision image quality is frustrating, and the motion tracking function is a bit wonky. Likewise, the Pro 3 uses no complimentary storage, and external storage can't be seen through the app, just via a computer. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, however for now, we still think the Arlo Pro 2 is a much better buy. Both are still much better than the expensive Arlo Ultra, which we found to have awful night-vision performance, poor battery life, and a tendency to miss out on far a lot of motion triggers.</p>

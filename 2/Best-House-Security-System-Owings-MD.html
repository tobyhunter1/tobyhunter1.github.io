As a result, faces are properly exposed at the door and in the shop, accomplishing the objective of catching video of everybody going into the store. HDR is now a basic feature in commercial cameras. Unfortunately, once clients realize that the economical customer camera they purchased is doing not have HDR, it's generally far too late since the cameras and recorders are set up.</p>

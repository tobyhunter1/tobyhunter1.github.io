<p>I just completed upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The crucial distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which permits you to fine-tune the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this very important feature. Also nice metal construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get proper mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the huge choice gadget into the wall. Must be a better method to implement that. But it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Very good resolution - better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and better clearness during the night. Hopefully these hold up over the years! Highly advise.</p>

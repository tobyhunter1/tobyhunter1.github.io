<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this issue with a special light-handling feature. These cameras utilize both a software application and hardware solution called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Range".

As far as anyone is concerned, the image looks totally normal since the entrance and space seem at the same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are correctly exposed at the door and in the store, accomplishing the goal of catching video of everybody going into the shop.

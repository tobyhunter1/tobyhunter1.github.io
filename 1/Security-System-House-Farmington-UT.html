If alarm usage resulted in boosted public safety-- that is, alarms led to much greater burglar apprehension rates or, ideally, fewer robberies throughout a whole jurisdiction-- its public worth would be more evident. Nevertheless, the fact that alarm calls are extremely incorrect and do not contribute substantially to police capability to capture burglars makes the underwriting of alarm action by police and whole neighborhoods (all taxpayers subsidize cops action to alarmed properties) a inefficient and costly approach to burglary decrease throughout a whole jurisdiction.</p>

As soon as the signal is received, the intruder alarm will wait to send another message if another zone is tripped. Entering the code on the burglar alarm's keypad and turning off the system will end this process with the ADT monitoring center.</p>

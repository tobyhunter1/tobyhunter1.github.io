<p>Absolutely nothing is more crucial than safeguarding what you treasure most ... your household and home. The foundation of a home security system is the base station. This unit is what communicates with all of the security sensing units and smart-home components in your house. Many connect to a home router, however if yours has Wi-Fi or cellular assistance, placement is more versatile. Contact sensing units are the first thing you must buy along with the base station; these attach to windows and doors and will inform you when they open. Other home security components include motion sensing units, keypads, key fobs, cameras, glass-break sensing units, and panic buttons.</p>

For instance, Scout only provides one security camera (and it's for indoor use just).

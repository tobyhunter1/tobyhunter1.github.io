<p>We looked for Do It Yourself systems that used expert monitoring, both with and without an agreement. Although some companies offer free or heavily discounted hardware in exchange for a service commitment that can last anywhere from one to five years, we discovered no-contract systems to be the most versatile. Some individuals might want to sign up for service just for when they or their partner runs out town, for example.

<p>Keypad: A mobile phone app is a should for usage when you're far from home, but you shouldn't have to fumble with your phone when you're coming and going. A keypad can sit by the front door, making it easy to arm and disarm the system. If you currently own a Ring video doorbell and wish to broaden your home security protection, adding Ring Alarm makes sense. When you add other Ring products to Call Alarm it ends up being a more robust security system that can deliver live video streaming, two-way interaction, and smart lighting. Obviously, at that point, the cheap price tag becomes more pricey.</p>
<p>Neither the light nor the camera is especially impressive by itself. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, however it's just 720p-- and we're beginning to anticipate 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera market. With that stated, we would not advise this system to tech-lovers, as we believe the functions are a little too basic. For instance, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more clever home functions. However if easy Do It Yourself installation, no-contracts, and inexpensive monitoring is your thing, we believe you'll like SimpliSafe.</p>

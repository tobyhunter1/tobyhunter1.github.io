<p>I simply ended up updating all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The key difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which enables you to modify the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this really essential feature. Likewise nice metal building and construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get appropriate mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the huge selection device into the wall. Should be a better method to implement that. However it was simply a little notch so not an offer breaker. Very good resolution - better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and much better clarity in the evening. Hopefully these hold up throughout the years! Extremely advise.</p>

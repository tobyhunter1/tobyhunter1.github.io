For example, no other company can monitor a SimpliSafe, Cox, Brinks Home, or Xfinity Home system. These companies developed their equipment this way to make customers stick with them longer, due to the fact that changing monitoring companies suggests hundreds of dollars down the drain and a big headache for clients.

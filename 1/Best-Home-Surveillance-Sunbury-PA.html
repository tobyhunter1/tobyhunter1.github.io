<p>Three big benefits of wireless security systems for occupants are their portability, expandability and impermanence. Tenants, unlike house owners, usually prevent making long-term changes to their homes.

For example, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more smart home features. However if simple Do It Yourself installation, no-contracts, and inexpensive monitoring is your thing, we think you'll enjoy SimpliSafe.</p>

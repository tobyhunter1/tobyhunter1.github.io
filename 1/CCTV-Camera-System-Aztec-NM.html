Using IP video encoders and other equipment such as digital video recorders and hybrid DVRs makes it possible to leverage your existing analog cameras while migrating into the world of digital surveillance.</p>

<p>Ahhh EZVIZ, the company that seems to aim to make a camera with the most hard setup known to guy. Here's how it plays out: First you need to put and download the app in your email address. Then you get in the WiFi information of the network you're trying to link to. Then the phone plays a screeching, electronic sound wave to the camera to transmit the WiFi info. (You should play this at complete volume or it will not work). Windows smash, pet dogs howl, felines squeal, babies weep. Not that you can hear; your ear drums will have burst in the first ten seconds. It doesn't work. And it never ever works.</p>

<p>There are two primary types of cameras that can be wired into a video surveillance system: web protocol (IP) cameras and the traditional analog cameras. IP cameras are the more modern version of analog cameras, and while the specific cameras tend to be a little bit more pricey, they use a variety of features that analog cameras do not.

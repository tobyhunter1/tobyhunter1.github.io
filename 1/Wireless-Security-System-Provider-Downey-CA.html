<p>A compelling argument in favor of getting the Circle Safe subscription is that it includes person detection, that makes for smarter smartphone alerts-- and, in some cases, less incorrect notifies. If the camera is pointed toward a high-traffic location, you won't have to stress over it tape-recording or sending out an alert every time the canine strolls by. (We believe this is a better feature if you're positioning the Circle 2 outside, where cars frequently pass.) Although having the subscription makes this camera smarter, it's terrific that it's not essential, as it is with some cameras, consisting of the Nest Web cam.</p>

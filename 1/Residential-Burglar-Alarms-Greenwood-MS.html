But suicide opponents are clearly not discouraged by video cameras - and may even be brought in to the tv protection cameras can guarantee - and the expense of a comprehensive video surveillance system such as Britain's - which draws up roughly 20 percent of that country's criminal justice spending plan - far exceeds the restricted advantages that the system may supply in investigating attacks or attempted attacks after the truth (see truth sheet on Surveillance Cameras and the Attempted London Attacks ).</p>

Nest's Secure has the best design of any system I checked, consisting of creative things like incorporating a motion and the keypad detector into the base station and combining motion detectors and entry sensing units into one system. But the Secure is expensive, extra sensing units are expensive, and the monitoring service-- which does not consist of emergency alarm or camera backups-- is likewise pricey if you do not dedicate to a three-year agreement.</p>

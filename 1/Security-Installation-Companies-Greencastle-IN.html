<p>Thanks to recent developments in technology, wireless security systems are now as reliable as wired systems If you've decided to install an alarm system, you must consider the following advantages of wireless technology. The $260 Basics package includes the base station, a keypad, 4 entry sensors, one motion sensor, a backyard sign, and two window decals. For $15 each month, you can add around-the-clock professional monitoring and a cellular connection, so the system can interact with the monitoring service without a landline. The $25-per-month Interactive plan includes control through iOS and Android smartphone apps, push and e-mail informs, and 30-day event-footage storage for endless cameras, including the SimpliSafe Video Doorbell Pro, which is offered separately. Without the $25 strategy, you manage all controls by means of the keypad.</p>

The largest drawback to an NVR system, nevertheless, is that not every IP camera will work with every NVR.

If alarm usage resulted in boosted public safety-- that is, alarms caused much higher burglar apprehension rates or, preferably, less break-ins throughout an entire jurisdiction-- its public worth would be more obvious. However, the truth that alarm calls are extremely incorrect and do not contribute substantially to cops capability to nab robbers makes the underwriting of alarm reaction by cops and entire neighborhoods (all taxpayers fund police reaction to alarmed residential or commercial properties) a inefficient and expensive approach to theft reduction across an entire jurisdiction.</p>

<p>We still think the Ring Alarm is a terrific option for a cheap home security system with smart home support. But maybe skip the cameras in the meantime. Hard disk drive storage is safe, secure, and convenient, with numerous systems offering expansion and free cloud storage, such as Arlo Pro 2 Wireless Home Security System. Where does the video feed go? Does the camera shop to an SD card, which you'll need to by hand get rid of to transfer the data? Does it go to your smart device, or upload to services like Dropbox? For the best security, you desire the data to be supported in several places. Another element is the number of days of video footage are archived.

<p>Neither the light nor the camera is especially remarkable on its own. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, but it's just 720p-- and we're beginning to anticipate 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera industry. With that stated, we wouldn't recommend this system to tech-lovers, as we think the features are a little too basic. For example, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more smart home features. But if simple Do It Yourself installation, no-contracts, and affordable monitoring is your thing, we think you'll like SimpliSafe.</p>

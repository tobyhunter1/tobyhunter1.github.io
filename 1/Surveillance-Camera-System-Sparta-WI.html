Storage capacity: For video recorders, the first concern you need to ask yourself is just how much storage you will need. The response depends upon a couple of elements: the number of cameras in your system, each camera's resolution, the quantity of archived footage you plan to save and how long you prepare to keep taped footage. If there are numerous cameras shooting in a greater resolution, the footage is going to consume storage area quickly. You can set a video recorder to "overwrite" the oldest video when you reach the system's capability, however if you're not mindful, the system might overwrite archived footage that you still require.</p>

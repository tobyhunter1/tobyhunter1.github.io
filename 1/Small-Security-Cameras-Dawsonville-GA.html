The normal factor for carrying out a DoS attack is to observe the healing of the wireless network, throughout which all of the initial handshake codes are re-transmitted by all devices, supplying a chance for the malicious aggressor to tape these codes and utilize different breaking tools to evaluate security weaknesses and exploit them to acquire unapproved access to the system. This works best on weakly encrypted systems such as WEP, where there are a variety of tools offered which can introduce a dictionary style attack of "potentially accepted" security keys based on the "model" security key recorded during the network recovery.</p>

<p>I simply finished upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The key difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which enables you to tweak the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal change. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this really essential feature. Also great metal building and construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get right mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the huge selection device into the wall. Should be a better way to execute that. However it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker. Excellent resolution - better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and better clearness during the night. Ideally these hold up over the years! Extremely advise.</p>

Another possible downside to wireless security is that the batteries on each piece of equipment must be replaced or charged routinely in order to keep the system working.

<p>The real factor cameras are usually released is to minimize much pettier crimes. However it has not even been shown that they can do that. In Britain, where cameras have been thoroughly deployed in public locations, sociologists studying the issue have discovered that they have actually not minimized criminal offense. "As soon as the criminal offense and offense figures were adjusted to take account of the general down trend in criminal offenses and offences," criminologists found in one research study, "decreases were noted in particular categories but there was no proof to suggest that the cameras had actually reduced crime overall in the city centre." A 2005 study for the British Home Office also found that cameras did not cut criminal offense or the worry of criminal activity (as had a 2002 study, likewise for the British federal government).</p>

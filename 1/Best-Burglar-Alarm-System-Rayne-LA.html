IP cameras work by using an IP (IP represents web protocol) network, frequently the very same information network the rest of a company utilizes. If bandwidth is a problem, a separate network utilizing classification 5 circuitry can be utilized. Either way, video information is tape-recorded on a server, which means video information can be located on website or in a remote area. After testing, we sent each of our top choices, along with the Wyze Webcam v2, to Bill McKinley, head of details security at The New York Times (Wirecutter's parent company), for hack screening.

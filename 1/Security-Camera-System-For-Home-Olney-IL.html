<p>Unlike many other cameras we evaluated, the corded Circle 2 does not have sensitivity settings for motion detection (though the cordless model does ). Rather, you can filter event notices only by high activity, days, or person (the latter is readily available just with a paid Circle Safe membership). Without a paid Circle Safe subscription, you'll get more signals, which you can just filter to get every minute, 15 minutes, or thirty minutes. When used in high-traffic areas, the subscription is more helpful. Otherwise, the Smart Place function can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to avoid informs every time you walk by. Unusually, though the app supports numerous users, its geofencing uses to each user individually, so if everyone in your family has the Circle app set up, you'll still get notices when other people are home.</p>

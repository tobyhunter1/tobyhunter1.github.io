<p>6 basic CCTV security camera innovations exist in todays CCTV surveillance markets. Plus, Amcrest is ONVIF compliant, which indicates you can use a number of different third-party apps, like Blue Iris, and make the camera deal with other ONVIF-compliant devices. We believe alarm systems work best when integrated with all parts of your security system, such as video monitoring and gain access to control.

<p>Ring Alarm is extremely economical and has good wise home support. However don't expect very stylish equipment.

<p>Neither the camera nor the light is particularly remarkable on its own. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, but it's only 720p-- and we're beginning to expect 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera industry.

For example, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more smart home functions. However if simple Do It Yourself installation, no-contracts, and inexpensive monitoring is your thing, we think you'll love SimpliSafe.</p>

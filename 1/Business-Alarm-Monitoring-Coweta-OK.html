<p>Cameras with built in wifi that talk to an existing network must be within 300 feet for optimal performance. With cameras that interact with wifi NVR's positioning of the camera close to the NVR is absolutely something to be considered. For instance if the only thing blocking the NVR from a camera is a window there wouldn't be much of a problem but if there is an insulated wall in between the camera and NVR or the NVR is down stairs and the camera is mounted on 2nd story wall, this would cause a disruption in the signal. A wireless bridge is an excellent option for long variety scenarios where trees and poles are not present.</p>

<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is good but not excellent-- therefore it isn't worth paying two times the cost of its predecessor. When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime watching. Nevertheless, color night vision image quality is frustrating, and the motion tracking function is a bit wonky. Also, the Pro 3 provides no totally free storage, and external storage can't be seen through the app, just by means of a computer system. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still think the Arlo Pro 2 is a much better buy. Both are still much better than the pricey Arlo Ultra, which we discovered to have awful night-vision efficiency, poor battery life, and a tendency to miss out on far too many motion sets off.</p>

Depending upon the variation chosen, it can be conscious various frequencies or levels of sound or vibration. The system is based upon electro-magnetic or coaxial sensor cable with the controller having the ability to distinguish between signals from the cable television or chainwire being cut, an intruder climbing up the fence, or bad climate condition.</p>
<p>Unlike most other cameras we evaluated, the corded Circle 2 does not have level of sensitivity settings for motion detection (though the cordless design does ).

Without a paid Circle Safe subscription, you'll get more notifies, which you can just filter to get every minute, 15 minutes, or 30 minutes. When used in high-traffic locations, the membership is more useful. Otherwise, the Smart Place function can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to prevent notifies each time you walk by. Strangely, though the app supports several users, its geofencing uses to each user separately, so if everybody in your household has the Circle app set up, you'll still get notices when other people are home.</p>

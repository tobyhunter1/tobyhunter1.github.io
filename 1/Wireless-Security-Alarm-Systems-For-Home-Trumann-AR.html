The key difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which enables you to tweak the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal modification.

Must be a much better method to execute that. But it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Very good resolution - far better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and better clarity in the evening. Hopefully these hold up throughout the years! Extremely suggest.</p>

But I also appreciate minimalist systems that elements that carry out more than one action, like Minut. Some elements can make home automation readily available to you. Whatever the components are (camera, motion sensor, window sensor, clever lock, etc.), I wish to ensure that they all easily communicate with your app that is constantly at hand, so you can keep an eye on them from afar.</p>

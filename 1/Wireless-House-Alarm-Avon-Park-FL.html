<p>Our burglar alarms might be equipped in the Away" or Stay" mode. Once the burglar alarms are activated, each monitored zone has the ability to recognize a violation. As soon as a zone has been broken, the intruder alarm system then dials an ADT monitoring center and transmits the message through a telephone line.

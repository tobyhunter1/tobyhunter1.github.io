<p>Our burglar alarms might be equipped in the Away" or Stay" mode. Once the burglar alarms are activated, each monitored zone has the ability to recognize a violation. As soon as a zone has been broken, the intruder alarm system then dials an ADT monitoring center and transmits the message through a telephone line. When the signal is received, the intruder alarm will wait to send out another message if another zone is tripped. Getting in the code on the burglar alarm's keypad and switching off the system will end this process with the ADT monitoring center.</p>

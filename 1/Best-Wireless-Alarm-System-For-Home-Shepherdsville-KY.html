Woot has likewise posted good deals on wireless security systems in the past. It's a bit harder to plan your purchase when shopping at Woot, as most of the offers are only readily available for 24-hours.

<p>For how long does it typically take to turn to your alarm monitoring service? I utilize VOIP today. May relocate to cellular eventually in the future but sticking with dial-up in the meantime.

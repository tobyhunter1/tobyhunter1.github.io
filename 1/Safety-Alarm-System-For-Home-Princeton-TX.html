<p>The DoS attack in itself does little to expose organizational data to a malicious assailant, because the disturbance of the network prevents the flow of data and in fact indirectly secures information by preventing it from being transmitted. The normal factor for performing a DoS attack is to observe the recovery of the wireless network, during which all of the preliminary handshake codes are re-transmitted by all devices, providing an opportunity for the destructive assaulter to record these codes and utilize various splitting tools to evaluate security weaknesses and exploit them to gain unapproved access to the system. This works best on weakly encrypted systems such as WEP, where there are a number of tools available which can release a dictionary design attack of "perhaps accepted" security secrets based upon the "design" security key captured during the network healing.</p>

If a weak password, such as a dictionary word or brief character string is used, WPA and WPA2 can be cracked. Utilizing an enough time random password (e.g. 14 random letters) or passphrase (e.g. 5 arbitrarily picked words) makes pre-shared crucial WPA essentially uncrackable. The 2nd generation of the WPA security procedure (WPA2) is based upon the final IEEE 802.11 i change to the 802.11 requirement and is eligible for FIPS 140-2 compliance. With all those file encryption schemes, any client in the network that understands the secrets can check out all the traffic.</p>

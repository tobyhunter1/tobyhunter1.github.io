<p>You might think you'll never ever be targeted, but why take the chance? An estimated 2,000,000 thefts happen in the United States every year. Theft prevention is a needed preventative measure to ensure the safety of your valuables. An alarm system can serve several functions to this end. In many cases, its presence can serve as a deterrent-- robbers are less apt to target an area where it is more likely that they will encounter such disturbance. In other scenarios, when they go through with the act, the alarm can serve to alert people in the location (along with the authorities) that something is awry. This ensures a quick action and decreases the burglar's chances of success.</p>
<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this issue with a special light-handling function. These cameras utilize both a software and hardware service called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the space and a direct exposure of the doorway and after that combines the two images together to produce a properly-exposed composite image of the 2 areas. As far as anybody is concerned, the image looks completely typical given that the entrance and room appear to be at the exact same brightness level. As a result, faces are appropriately exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the objective of recording video of everyone getting in the shop. HDR is now a basic feature in commercial cameras. Sadly, when customers recognize that the low-cost consumer camera they bought is lacking HDR, it's generally far too late considering that the recorders and cameras are installed.</p>

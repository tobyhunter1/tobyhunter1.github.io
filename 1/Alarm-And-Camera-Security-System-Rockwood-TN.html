The second guard arrived in the middle of the night and took over. When I arrived in the early morning to get the event started, he was also expert, encouraging and courteous. We were really pleased with your service and I will recommend that we call on your company next year for this occasion. Thank you, Dennis and Henry, for a good night's sleep. When after leaving our home in your hands, I didn't worry.</p>

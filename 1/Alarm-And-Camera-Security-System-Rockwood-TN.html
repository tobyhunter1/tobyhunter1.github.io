The very first guard arrived early so he could take a look at the whole area and talk with me about my concerns. He was professional, considerate and very encouraging. The second guard arrived in the middle of the night and took over. When I arrived in the early morning to get the event started, he was also expert, encouraging and courteous. We were really pleased with your service and I will recommend that we call on your company next year for this occasion. Thank you, Dennis and Henry, for a good night's sleep. When after leaving our home in your hands, I didn't worry.</p>

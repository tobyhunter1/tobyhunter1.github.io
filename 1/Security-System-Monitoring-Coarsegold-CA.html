Recordings are captured as 10-second clips that are stored for approximately 24 hours, unless you pay the $8 month-to-month fee (or $80 per year) to keep 30-second clips for 1 month. Beyond those limitations, we often found action missing, thanks to irregular and lengthy gaps in between recordings. Also, the camera itself gets exceedingly hot.</p>

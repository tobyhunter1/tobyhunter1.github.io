We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, however for now, we still believe the Arlo Pro 2 is a much better buy. Both are still better than the costly Arlo Ultra, which we discovered to have terrible night-vision performance, poor battery life, and a propensity to miss out on far a lot of motion activates.</p>

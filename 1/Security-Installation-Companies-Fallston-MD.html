However, those features come at a relatively steep rate: $5 monthly ($50 annually) for the first camera for 5 days of video history, $10 monthly ($100 per year) for 10 days of video history, or $30 each month ($300 each year) for one month of video history.  For each additional camera, the subscription is discounted to about half of the initial cost.

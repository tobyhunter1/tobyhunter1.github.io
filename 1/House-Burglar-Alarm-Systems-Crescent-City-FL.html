<p>CR's take: The Wyze Webcam V2 is a great security camera and a phenomenal value. It receives an Exceptional score for video quality and is much easier to utilize than the other cameras on this list. It also does well in our privacy and security tests. The camera features a rolling 14 days of totally free storage for motion-trigged video, individual detection, voice control through Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant, and the capability to save video in your area on an SD card.

These cameras hold true 1080p and work completely right out of package. They are well lined up and focused. The clarity is really excellent. Night vision is true 1080p at around 40ft, but still can see respectable after that. These cameras are what you require to buy, and do not go cheap.</p>

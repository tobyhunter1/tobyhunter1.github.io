Smart alarm systems altered that. Originally, traditional security systems were hardwired into the home and monitored by a main station, typically a home alarm company.

Both are still much better than the pricey Arlo Ultra, which we found to have dreadful night-vision performance, bad battery life, and a tendency to miss far a lot of motion activates.</p>

Nevertheless, the fact that alarm calls are extremely false and do not contribute significantly to authorities ability to nab burglars makes the underwriting of alarm action by cops and whole communities (all taxpayers support authorities response to alarmed homes) a inefficient and expensive approach to burglary decrease across an entire jurisdiction.</p>

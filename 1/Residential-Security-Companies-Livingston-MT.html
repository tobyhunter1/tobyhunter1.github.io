<p>Another important topic to go over is camera resolution. It can be confusing to understand how much is enough. In this short article, the term resolution" refers to the number of dots (pixels) that make up a video picture; the more dots, the more detailed the video image. The very same is true of high-resolution TV sets, and the 2 most popular TELEVISION resolutions today are 1080p and 4K. 4K resolution consists of about four times as much image information as 1080p. Surveillance cameras are also manufactured in these two resolutions, and it would be natural to think that the more dots in your video image the better, right? Yes and no. When it concerns surveillance cameras, there are some difficult repercussions to having such a high-resolution 4K image. In this case, more is not always much better.</p>

The infrared energy given off by an object is called its heat signature. In basic, the hotter an item is, the more radiation it emits. A thermal camera includes a heat sensing unit that is capable of identifying small distinctions in temperature level. The device collects the infrared radiation from items in the scene and develops an electronic image based upon details about the temperature level distinctions.

<p>What many individuals do not recognize is that there is another class of security camera that is directly offered to the general public, though not found in the big box and warehouse stores. These surveillance cameras are categorized as "commercial-grade" security cameras and are the kind of camera used by these big box chains to secure their stock. Look at the ceiling of customer electronics shops and storage facility chains and you will discover in each aisle a white dome camera that is larger than the average customer camera. Let that sink in for a minute ... these companies do not even use the type of cameras they are selling to the public, and there is a good reason.</p>

Making an upgrade from a hardwired system is normally a basic process, and it is often possible to bring all of your existing gadgets and sensors to the new wireless system. If you have old hardwired devices, you can interface them with a wireless panel by including a wired to wireless converter, such as the Honeywell 5800C2W.</p>

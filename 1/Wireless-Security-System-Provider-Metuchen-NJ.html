<p>The Hive View provides fantastic 1080p images day and night, but the motion activation triggered too quickly, even when on the most affordable level of sensitivity setting. Since this camera has no native geofencing functions, you need to manually stop notifications (and recording, considering that it does that even when notices are off). We also experienced above-average connectivity concerns, with 2 Hive test systems detaching 8 times over two months. Scout is very simple to use, particularly if you're a fan of mobile phones. The Scout mobile app works for iOS, Android, and web-based browsers, and it enables you to manage nearly every aspect of the security system remotely, and it's highly adjustable. Inside the app, you can even control email subscriptions, SMS signals, or the in-app notifications.</p>
<p>I just ended up updating all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The crucial difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which enables you to tweak the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal change. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely crucial feature. Likewise good metal construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get correct mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the big selection device into the wall. Should be a better way to implement that. But it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Great resolution - much better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and better clarity during the night. Hopefully these hold up over the years! Highly recommend.</p>

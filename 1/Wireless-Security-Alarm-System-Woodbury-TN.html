<p>So, while alarm systems may have some advantage for alarm owners as part of a general security plan, the concern remains whether non-alarm owners in the neighborhood should carry a share of the cost. If alarm use resulted in improved public safety-- that is, alarms caused much greater burglar apprehension rates or, preferably, fewer break-ins across a whole jurisdiction-- its public value would be more evident.

Nevertheless, the fact that alarm calls are overwhelmingly false and do not contribute substantially to police ability to nab burglars makes the underwriting of alarm action by police and whole neighborhoods (all taxpayers support police action to alarmed residential or commercial properties) a costly and inefficient  technique to robbery reduction across an entire jurisdiction.</p>

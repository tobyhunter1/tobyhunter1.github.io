The cameras invested weeks protecting our front door, alerting us to good friends, member of the family, delivery individuals, and even the milkman.

<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this issue with a special light-handling function.

As far as anyone is concerned, the image looks entirely regular since the doorway and space seem at the exact same brightness level. As a result, faces are appropriately exposed at the door and in the shop, accomplishing the objective of recording video of everybody entering the store.

The innovation slowly evolved into the extremely advanced yet budget friendly systems offered today.

However, color night vision image quality is frustrating, and the motion tracking function is a bit wonky. Likewise, the Pro 3 offers no complimentary storage, and external storage can't be seen through the app, only via a computer system. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still believe the Arlo Pro 2 is a better buy. Both are still better than the costly Arlo Ultra, which we found to have terrible night-vision efficiency, poor battery life, and a tendency to miss out on far too many motion triggers.</p>

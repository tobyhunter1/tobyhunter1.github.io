<p>The DoS attack in itself does little to expose organizational information to a harmful assailant, because the disturbance of the network prevents the flow of data and actually indirectly protects information by avoiding it from being transferred. The normal factor for carrying out a DoS attack is to observe the recovery of the wireless network, during which all of the preliminary handshake codes are re-transmitted by all devices, offering a chance for the destructive assaulter to tape-record these codes and utilize different cracking tools to evaluate security weak points and exploit them to get unapproved access to the system. This works best on weakly encrypted systems such as WEP, where there are a number of tools offered which can release a dictionary design attack of "possibly accepted" security keys based on the "model" security key recorded throughout the network recovery.</p>
<p>We looked for Do It Yourself systems that used expert monitoring, both with and without an agreement.

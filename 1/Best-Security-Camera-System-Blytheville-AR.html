<p>So, while alarm might have some benefit for alarm owners as part of a general security plan, the concern remains whether non-alarm owners in the neighborhood need to take on a share of the cost. If alarm use led to improved public safety-- that is, alarms led to much higher burglar apprehension rates or, preferably, less break-ins throughout a whole jurisdiction-- its public worth would be more obvious. However, the truth that alarm calls are extremely incorrect and do not contribute significantly to police ability to apprehend burglars makes the underwriting of alarm action by authorities and whole neighborhoods (all taxpayers subsidize authorities response to alarmed residential or commercial properties) a expensive and ineffective  approach to theft decrease across a whole jurisdiction.</p>

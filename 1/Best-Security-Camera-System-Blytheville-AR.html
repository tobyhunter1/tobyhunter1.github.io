<p>So, while alarm might have some benefit for alarm owners as part of a general security plan, the concern remains whether non-alarm owners in the neighborhood need to take on a share of the cost. If alarm use led to improved public safety-- that is, alarms led to much higher burglar apprehension rates or, preferably, less break-ins throughout a whole jurisdiction-- its public worth would be more obvious.

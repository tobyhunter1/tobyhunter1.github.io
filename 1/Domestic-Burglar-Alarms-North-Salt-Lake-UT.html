<p>Connecting analog cameras with a DVR system is done by way of directly plugging a BNC cable from the DVR into the camera. To connect more cameras to the DVR system, you need extra cable televisions. DVR systems are tough to scale up since once every BNC connection is occupied by a camera, you require to acquire a totally new DVR prior to adding another camera to the system. DVRs also need that the linked cameras be in close proximity to the recorder; otherwise, the video quality begins to degrade.</p>
<p>The Wi-Fi Protected Gain Access To (WPA and WPA2) security procedures were later developed to resolve the issues with WEP. If a weak password, such as a dictionary word or short character string is used, WPA and WPA2 can be broken. Using a long enough random password (e.g. 14 random letters) or passphrase (e.g. 5 arbitrarily picked words) makes pre-shared essential WPA essentially uncrackable. The second generation of the WPA security protocol (WPA2) is based on the final IEEE 802.11 i modification to the 802.11 requirement and is eligible for FIPS 140-2 compliance.

The monetary self-reliance alone makes this alternative much better for some families.

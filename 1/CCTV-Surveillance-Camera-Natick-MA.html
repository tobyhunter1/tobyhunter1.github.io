<p>3 huge benefits of wireless security systems for renters are their impermanence, mobility and expandability. Tenants, unlike house owners, generally avoid making long-term changes to their homes. Hardwired security systems for that reason aren't useful; they involve drilling into walls and setting up permanent electrical circuits. In contrast, wireless security utilizes equipment that's either freestanding or affixed to walls and entranceways with removable adhesive. Wireless control board, sensing units and other elements can easily be set up at different homes later on, and wireless systems are quickly expanded with new parts too. Wireless security strategies also allow push-button control of the system and basic home automation.

We like that the system consists of a wifi security camera and just informs you when motion is produced by something with the very same heat pattern as a human (making sure there's no incorrect informs). However, you do require to sign up for the external monitoring service (from ₤ 12.99 per month) to be able to view recording from the wifi security camera and get informs on your phone if the sensing units have been activated. There's no external alarm either. Other packages are readily available that have additional sensing units and essential fobs, too.</p>

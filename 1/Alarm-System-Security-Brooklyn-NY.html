<p>Thank you for your feedback, Don. We've discovered that battery life never ever matches the maker's statistics considering that this comes from tests in a controlled environment without continuous video recording, which is the greatest perpetrator for short battery life without a doubt. We agree with you about Blink's superior battery life over on our outdoor security camera review, but its recording capability is a bit minimal to recommend as a top choice.</p>
<p>The motion detection is excellent, and the app is a satisfaction to utilize too (a lot better than the apps you get with some spending plan security cameras), though if you want to enter its cleverest customisations, there is a little bit of a learning curve. For even more basic smarts, it's excellent, though.

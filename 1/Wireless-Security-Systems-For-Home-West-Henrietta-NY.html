Someone has to be actively watching the video screens for all 10,000 cameras if they are going to attempt to find criminal activity prior to it takes place.

Now, many security systems involve a multitude of parts, such as a base station, security camera, motion, entry, and glass break sensors, a keypad, and crucial fobs, to name a few components. However I also appreciate minimalist systems that parts that carry out more than one action, like Minut. Some elements can make home automation readily available to you. Whatever the components are (camera, motion sensing unit, window sensor, clever lock, etc.), I want to ensure that they all quickly interact with your app that is constantly at hand, so you can keep an eye on them from afar.</p>

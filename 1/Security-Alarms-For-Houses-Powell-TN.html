<p>I just finished upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The essential distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which permits you to modify the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal change.

Needed to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the substantial choice device into the wall. Must be a better method to execute that. However it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Excellent resolution - better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and better clearness during the night. Hopefully these hold up over the years! Extremely recommend.</p>

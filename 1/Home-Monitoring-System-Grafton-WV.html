<p>If you have an interest in a 4K camera system, you preferably will have a very high-speed Web connection and a robust home network, ideally an enterprise-grade network. As talked about above, the 4K camera images are huge, which is a lot of information to push around the home's network and optionally, to an offsite cloud recording service (more on that below). Rely on your HTA Certified technology professional for guidance here, as they will have the ability to identify if a 4K camera system will work in your situation. Some of the much better camera system brand names have controls to change a few of the recording specifications in order for slower network connections to still work reliably.

<p>Keypad: A smart device app is a must for use when you're far from home, but you should not have to fumble with your phone when you're reoccuring. A keypad can sit by the front door, making it easy to arm and deactivate the system. Including Ring Alarm makes sense if you currently own a Ring video doorbell and desire to expand your home security protection.

The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, however it's just 720p-- and we're beginning to expect 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera market. With that said, we wouldn't suggest this system to tech-lovers, as we believe the functions are a little too basic. For example, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more wise home functions. But if simple DIY installation, no-contracts, and low-cost monitoring is your thing, we believe you'll enjoy SimpliSafe.</p>

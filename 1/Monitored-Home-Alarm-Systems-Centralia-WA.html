A separate network using classification 5 wiring can be used if bandwidth is an issue. Either way, video info is tape-recorded on a server, which indicates video data can be located on site or in a remote place. After screening, we sent each of our top choices, as well as the Wyze Cam v2, to Costs McKinley, head of information security at The New york city Times (Wirecutter's parent company), for hack screening.

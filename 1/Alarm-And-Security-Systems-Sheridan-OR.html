<p>The 2nd primary difference is the pricing. Wired systems can be infamously pricey. Every aspect of the system will cost you money. So, at the end, who's robbing who?

<p>So, while alarm might have some advantage for alarm owners as part of an overall security plan, the concern remains whether non-alarm owners in the community ought to take on a share of the cost. If alarm usage resulted in boosted public safety-- that is, alarms resulted in much higher burglar apprehension rates or, ideally, less thefts throughout a whole jurisdiction-- its public value would be more evident. Nevertheless, the truth that alarm calls are extremely incorrect and do not contribute significantly to authorities ability to apprehend burglars makes the underwriting of alarm response by cops and entire neighborhoods (all taxpayers support police action to alarmed properties) a inefficient and expensive approach to theft reduction across an entire jurisdiction.</p>

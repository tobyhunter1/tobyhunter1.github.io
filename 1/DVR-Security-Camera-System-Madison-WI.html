<p>I just ended up upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The key difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which allows you to fine-tune the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this very essential feature. Likewise good metal building. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get proper mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the big choice gadget into the wall. Should be a much better method to carry out that. However it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker. Excellent resolution - better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and much better clearness during the night. Hopefully these hold up throughout the years! Highly suggest.</p>

<p>As a temptation to buy an alarm system, a number of companies use "free monitoring services" for the first few months.

Nest's Secure has the best design of any system I checked, consisting of clever things like integrating the keypad and a motion detector into the base station and integrating motion detectors and entry sensors into one unit.

<p>ADT licensed provider SafeStreets charges a $99 (or more) installation cost, however the brand name doesn't otherwise charge up front for a system it says deserves $1,300. The equipment's all offered by 3rd parties, so what you receive may be from a various maker than the equipment your next-door neighbor got. Why's that? ADT uses an independent distributor design involving third-party dealerships. The dealerships identify which equipment to utilize. Expenses for systems differ. Larger systems that provide full-house protection with professional monitoring are the most pricey options. Smaller sized, self-monitored systems are the most inexpensive choice.</p>

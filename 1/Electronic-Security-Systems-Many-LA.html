<p>Ahhh EZVIZ, the company that appears to make every effort to make a camera with the most difficult setup known to male. Here's how it plays out: First you need to download the app and put in your email address. Then you go into the WiFi information of the network you're attempting to connect to. Then the phone plays a screeching, electronic sound wave to the camera to transfer the WiFi information. (You should play this at full volume or it will not work). Windows smash, canines howl, cats squeal, infants weep. Not that you can hear; your ear drums will have burst in the very first 10 seconds. It does not work. And it never works.</p>
<p>The rest of Nest's security equipment is top quality, if not particularly revolutionary, so we're really recommending the security cameras here. Some small-business owners will also like Nest's contract-free plan alternative. Sure, you get a lower cost if you opt for a three-year contract, however since Nest requires you to pay 100% of your staying agreement if you cancel, it's a huge commitment. So choose what will be the much better offer for you. If you know you'll sit tight for at least three years, choose the contract and gain those cost savings. But if you might upgrade to a new office with different security needs, contract-free is your best bet.</p>

<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is good but not great-- therefore it isn't worth paying twice the rate of its predecessor. When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime viewing. However, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky. Also, the Pro 3 provides no totally free storage, and external storage can't be seen through the app, just via a computer. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still believe the Arlo Pro 2 is a much better buy. Both are still better than the expensive Arlo Ultra, which we found to have awful night-vision efficiency, poor battery life, and a tendency to miss far a lot of motion triggers.</p>

The camera quality isn't half bad, there's a strong night-vision mode, and all the app controls are relatively obvious. You have actually got two-way audio, you can play melodies just to let the person being seen know they're being viewed, and you can pick to tape video or pictures and conserve them to your clever gadget on an impulse.</p>

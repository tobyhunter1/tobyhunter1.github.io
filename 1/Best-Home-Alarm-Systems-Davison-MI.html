<p>I simply completed updating all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The essential distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which allows you to fine-tune the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this very important feature. Also nice metal building. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get appropriate mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the huge selection gadget into the wall. Must be a better method to carry out that. However it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Excellent resolution - better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and much better clarity during the night. Hopefully these hold up for many years! Highly recommend.</p>

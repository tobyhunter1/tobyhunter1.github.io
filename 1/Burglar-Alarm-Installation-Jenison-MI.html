Anything added extra you would own however if you don't renew their high priced plan they'll eliminate their" equipment leaving you without any working alarm system. Simply another tricky method to keep highly profitable accounts.</p>
<p>If a worker (trusted entity) brings in a wireless router and plugs it into an unsecured switchport, the entire network can be exposed to anyone within range of the signals.

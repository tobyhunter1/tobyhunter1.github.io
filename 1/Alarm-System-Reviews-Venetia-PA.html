<p>I just completed updating all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The key difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which allows you to modify the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this really crucial function. Also nice metal building and construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get appropriate mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the big choice device into the wall. Should be a better way to execute that. However it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Very good resolution - far better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and better clearness in the evening. Ideally these hold up for many years! Highly advise.</p>

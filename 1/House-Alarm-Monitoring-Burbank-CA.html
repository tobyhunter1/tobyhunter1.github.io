Wireless security systems are more integratable and agile, but low signal strength and poor connection are still typical problems. Hardwired systems need minimal maintenance, and except a basic power blackout, are harder to interfere with. Despite a basic enhancement in wireless technology, there appear to be less ways for hardwired systems to be interfered with and disarmed.</p>

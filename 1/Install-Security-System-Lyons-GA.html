<p>I simply ended up upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The crucial difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which permits you to modify the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely important function. Likewise good metal building. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get right mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the big choice device into the wall. Must be a better method to execute that. However it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Great resolution - far better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and better clarity in the evening. Ideally these hold up over the years! Highly advise.</p>

<p>Note: The above CCTV camera types only touch the IP camera world and overlook the old analog cameras, given that everyone prefers IP cameras today for their economical prices, functions and easy setup.

This along with lawn indications and window stickers (offered on Amazon) might suffice to discourage small time scoundrels.

<p>Neither the camera nor the light is especially impressive by itself. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, however it's only 720p-- and we're beginning to expect 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera industry. With that stated, we wouldn't advise this system to tech-lovers, as we believe the functions are a little too basic. For example, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more clever home functions. However if simple Do It Yourself installation, no-contracts, and affordable monitoring is your thing, we believe you'll love SimpliSafe.</p>

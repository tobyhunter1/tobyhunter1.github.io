For the most detailed coverage of your residential or commercial property, you desire something that consists of night vision and can tape-record at a decent quality - and practically all cameras now come with a minimum of HD (1080p) resolution.

<p>Closed circuit tv (CCTV) surveillance is a type of situational crime prevention created to prevent both personal and home criminal activity and can be used in place of, or in addition to, police. Public surveillance cameras monitor, record, and transmit images of a specific location of interest and are either monitored remotely by security workers or preprogramed to scan the defined area (La Vigne et al. 2011). It is believed that the increased surveillance provided by CCTV will decrease crime and increase arrest, without displacing criminal offense to other neighboring locations where CCTV is not in usage (Ratcliffe 2009).</p>
